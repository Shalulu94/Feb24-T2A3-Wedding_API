# Term 2 Assignment 2 - Wedding API

## Purpose

Wedding planning in general is already a very daunting task and for majority of us, it is the first and last time we will ever need to do it! There are several vendors out there and an unlimited amount of things that could be added to a wedding and it can very easily and very quickly become overwhelming. 

The purpose of my App is to assist our users with their wedding planning by providing a platform that helps them to keep track of their tasks, budgets and connect with potential suppliers. 

This app will have separate rules and authorisation levels depending on whether you're a user or a supplier. Users will be able to create an account for their own use, browse through potential suppliers and create a checklist to help them organise and progress through their wedding planning. 

Suppliers will have a separate authorisation level and is aimed at giving them the ability to market their services over the app by creating a storefront. User's will be able to view their stores to get an idea of the different services that they provide, different packages and also their pricing. Users will also be able to leave reviews on these store pages to provide insight on their experiences to further assist other users when they are making a decision on which supplier to use. 

## Project Tracking

Within this project, I will be using Trello to plan my tasks and keep track of what I have completed as the project progresses. I will be using 4 separate lists to keep track of the status of my tasks which will include:
- To Do: List of items that I need to beging and have not yet started work on
- In progress: Currently started working on but not yet ready for testing. Ideally I will tackle one item at a time, however there could be multiple pieces in play at any given time
- Testing: Once an task has been completed the functionality will need to be tested. This will not apply to all items, but mainly part of the coding process
- Completed: Tasks that have passed the testing phase and are now ready
